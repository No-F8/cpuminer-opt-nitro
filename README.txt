NitroMiner is a customized, open-source fork of cpuminer-opt designed by NitroPool
for community-oriented, low-diff mining.

This release features:

Nitro branding and custom banner output

No dev fees — 100% free

Maintained for stability on SHA256, Yescrypt, and Scrypt variants

Binaries are officially available only from:

https://github.com/No-F8/cpuminer-opt-nitro/releases

No other sources should be trusted.

NitroMiner is a command-line program with no GUI or mouse support.
Run it from Terminal or Command Prompt. Usage examples and algorithm
options are provided with --help.

Virus Warnings:
Miner programs are often flagged as malware. This is a false positive caused by
antivirus heuristics. The source code is public and transparent. If you do not
trust the binary, compile from source instead.

Recommended Binaries (pick the one best matching your CPU):

cpuminer-avx2               Haswell, Skylake, Zen+

cpuminer-avx2-sha           AMD Zen1, Zen2

cpuminer-avx2-sha-vaes      AMD Zen3, Intel Alderlake (P-cores only)

cpuminer-avx512             Intel Skylake-X, Cascadelake

cpuminer-avx512-sha-vaes   AMD Zen4, Intel Rocketlake/Icelake

Older CPU Compatibility:

cpuminer-sse2               Generic x86_64 (Core2, Nehalem)

cpuminer-avx                Sandy/Ivy Bridge

Budget CPUs like Pentium or Celeron may lack modern instruction sets and
performance will be reduced. Very old AMD CPUs like Athlon X2 and Phenom II x4
are not supported due to incomplete SSE2 implementations.
